# housing-descrimination
study to explore discrimination in privately owned rental properties

## Continuation of 241 expiriment
Goals:
1. Identify housing data source to scrape: craigslist reply breaks TOS and will land us in hot water - we need to pivot
2. Re-establish goals and hypotheses based on what we've learned: at this time, we should re-engage with Alex.
3. Re-visit experiment administration plan: what went well and what needs to change?
4. Name and city selection
5. email server
6. difference of means / multi-variate regression / other
7. write a paper - overleaf is a fun tool
8. peer review: Alex again
9. formal submittal to publications / grants
